# 🚀 50 Days of Coding with Java ☕

Welcome to my **50 Days of Coding with Java** challenge! 🎯
This repository is a collection of daily coding practices, problem-solving exercises, and Java project snippets that I’ve worked on consistently for 50 days to strengthen my programming and logical thinking skills. 💪

## 📘 About the Challenge

This challenge is all about **discipline, consistency, and growth**.
Every day, I explored a new topic, solved coding problems, or built small projects using **Java** — from basic concepts to advanced problem-solving techniques.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Here’s an overview of what’s included across the 50 days 👇

| Day Range | Topics Covered                                                     |
