##ðŸ§  50 Days of Coding: Java

Welcome to my journey of mastering Java in 50 days! This repository documents daily progress, concepts learned, and hands-on practice as I explore the fundamentals and advanced topics of Java programming.

## ðŸ“… Day 1: Java Basics

Todayâ€™s focus was on building a strong foundation with the core building blocks of Java. Here's what I covered:

### âœ… Checklist
1. **Java Variables**  
   - Declaring and initializing variables  
   - Understanding scope and naming conventions  
   - Primitive vs reference types

2. **Java Output**  
   - Using `System.out.println()` and `System.out.print()`  
   - Formatting output for readability  
   - Escape sequences like `\n`, `\t`, etc.

3. **Java Identifiers**  
   - Rules for naming variables, methods, classes  
   - Valid vs invalid identifiers  
   - Best practices for naming conventions

4. **Java Data Types**  
   - Primitive types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.  
   - Non-primitive types: Strings, Arrays, Classes  
   - Type casting and type inference
